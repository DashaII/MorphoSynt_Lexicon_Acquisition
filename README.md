**Project Description**

In this project, I developed a lexicon for a rule-based Russian morphological analyzer, focusing on the rapid categorization of lexemes for nouns and verbs. I extracted each lexeme with its lemma, stem, and inflectional class. This lexicon encodes critical morphological information required to generate and analyze word forms, supporting the development of a complete morphological analyzer.
